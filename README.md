## Description

This project is a Java-based desktop application for simulating and analyzing personal investment portfolios.

It allows users to create a virtual investment account, buy and sell stocks, visualize portfolio composition, and evaluate portfolio risk based on historical volatility.

The main goal of the project is to demonstrate the application of object-oriented design, data analysis, and software engineering principles in the context of financial portfolio management.

The system focuses on explainable statistical risk analysis rather than market prediction.
